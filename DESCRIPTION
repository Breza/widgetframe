Description: This package provides two functions `frameableWidget`, and `frameWidget`.
  The `frameableWidget` is used to add extra code to a htmlwidget which
  allows is to be rendered correctly inside a responsive iframe.
  The `frameWidget` is a htmlwidget which displays content of another htmlwidget
  inside a responsive iframe.
  These functions allow for easier embedding of htmlwidgets in CMS systems
  such as wordpress, blogger etc.
  They also allow for seperation of widget content from main HTML content where
  CSS styles of the main HTML could interfere with the widget.
